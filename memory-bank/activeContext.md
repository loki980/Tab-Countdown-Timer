# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The project is stable after the release of version 1.3.0. The main focus has been on maintenance and minor bug fixes.

## Recent Changes
- **Feature Removal:** The experimental "auto-start at 10pm for YouTube" feature has been completely removed from the codebase to simplify the extension and remove niche functionality.
- **Bug Fix:** Addressed a visual issue where the popup did not render correctly in light mode.
- **Documentation:** The `README.md` file was updated to provide clearer instructions and reflect the current project structure.

## Next Steps
The extension is in a stable state. Future work will focus on addressing any user-reported issues or exploring community-requested features.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The removal of the 10pm auto-start feature was a strategic decision to streamline the extension's purpose and reduce maintenance overhead.
- The project will remain in a maintenance phase until new feature development is prioritized.
