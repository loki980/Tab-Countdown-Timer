# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Ensuring YouTube auto timers do not override user-configured countdowns.

## Recent Changes
Updated `background/background.js` so auto-created 10 PM alarms skip tabs that already have an alarm set, preventing manual timers from being reset.

## Next Steps
Confirm whether any additional scheduling preferences are needed beyond the 10 PM default.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
Automatic YouTube timers now run only when a tab lacks an alarm; existing alarms are preserved to respect user overrides.
