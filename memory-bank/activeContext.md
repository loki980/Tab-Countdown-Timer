# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Completed a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul of the popup based on an expert evaluation. The focus was on improving usability, state clarity, and fixing layout issues.

## Recent Changes
- **UI Refinement:** Adjusted popup layout to eliminate scrollbars and improve visual balance.
- **State Clarity:**
    - The "Start timer" button is now disabled when the duration is zero.
    - The button text changes to "Update timer" when a countdown is active.
    - "Cancel" button was renamed to "Stop timer" for clarity.
    - A distinct color is now used for the "Pause" button's paused state.
- **Improved Ergonomics:** Implemented Shift + Mouse Wheel to adjust minute inputs by Â±5 for faster timer setting.
- **Code Quality:** Refactored `popup.js` to remove duplicated countdown logic into a single, unified function.
- **Discoverability:** The YouTube-specific "Pause Video" action is now presented more clearly within a titled fieldset.

## Next Steps
With the UI overhaul complete, the next focus is to validate that no regressions were introduced and confirm the extension is stable.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The UI evaluation highlighted several accessibility opportunities (like `aria-live` for countdowns), which were deferred for now to focus on layout and core usability.
- The decision was made to keep the separate Hours and Minutes inputs but enhance them with keyboard/mouse shortcuts, rather than moving to a single duration field.
