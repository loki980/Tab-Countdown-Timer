# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The user has requested a full update of the memory bank to reflect the latest project state.

## Recent Changes
- **Release Script:** `release.sh` was updated to exclude `*.zip` files from new release packages.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** 
    - The popup UI now allows for more flexible minute and hour inputs, including handling overflow and underflow gracefully.
    - Keyboard arrow keys can be used to increment/decrement timer values.
    - The mouse wheel can be used to adjust timer values, with `Shift` key accelerating changes for minutes.
- **Code Quality & Bug Fixes:**
    - Added extensive commenting to the `ChromeAPIWrapper` in `background.js` for better clarity.
    - The background script now verifies that a tab exists before attempting to close it, preventing errors.
    - The feature that automatically set a 10 PM timer for YouTube tabs has been completely removed.
- **Version Bumps:** The manifest version has been updated to 1.3.1.

## Next Steps
The memory bank is being updated to accurately reflect the current state of the project.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The decision to remove the 10 PM auto-timer for YouTube simplifies the extension's logic and gives users more direct control.
- The UI enhancements focus on improving the speed and ease of setting custom timers.
