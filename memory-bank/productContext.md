# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project exists to help users manage their time online by allowing them to set a timer for a tab.

## Problems It Solves
It solves the problem of users getting lost in their tabs and spending too much time on certain websites, especially YouTube.

## How It Should Work
The extension allows the user to set a timer for a tab. When the timer expires, the tab will be closed or, if it's a YouTube tab, the video will be paused. The user can also pause and resume the timer.

## User Experience Goals
The user experience goals are to make the extension easy to use, intuitive, and unobtrusive. The timer should be easy to set and cancel, and the badge should be clear and informative.
