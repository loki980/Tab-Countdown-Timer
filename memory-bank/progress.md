# Progress

## What Works
- **Core Functionality:** The basic structure of the extension, including the popup and background script, is stable. Timer creation, pausing, and cancellation all function correctly.
- **YouTube Integration:** The extension correctly identifies YouTube tabs, provides a "Pause Video" option, and respects user-set timers over any automatic defaults.
- **UI/UX:** The popup interface is now significantly more intuitive and robust:
    - The layout is clean, balanced, and free of scrollbars.
    - UI controls are state-aware (e.g., "Start" vs. "Update", disabled states).
    - User input is enhanced with keyboard and mouse shortcuts (arrow keys, Shift+wheel).
    - Countdown display includes an ETA for clarity.
- **Code Health:** Redundant countdown logic in `popup.js` has been refactored into a single, unified function, improving maintainability.

## What's Left to Build
- **Accessibility:** While the core UI is functional, further accessibility improvements (such as `aria-live` regions for screen readers) could be implemented.
- **Content Script:** A content script could enable more direct and reliable interaction with YouTube's video player, potentially offering more features than the current background script approach.
- **Error Handling:** More robust error handling could be added around Chrome API calls.

## Current Status
Version 1.3.0 has been released. The extension is stable. The "auto-pause at 10pm" feature was removed.

## Known Issues
None. The previously identified UI layout and light mode rendering issues have been resolved.
