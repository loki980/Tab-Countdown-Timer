# Progress

## What Works
Basic structure of the extension, including the popup and background script. Timer functionality and tab closing/YouTube pausing. YouTube tabs now keep user-specified countdowns without reverting to the default 10 PM pause.

## What's Left to Build
Potentially a content script for more direct interaction with YouTube, additional features or improvements.

## Current Status
Bug fix in place to stop automatic 10 PM timers from replacing custom alarms on YouTube tabs; documentation updated accordingly.

## Known Issues
None.
