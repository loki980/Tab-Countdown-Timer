# Progress

## What Works
- **Core Functionality:** The basic structure of the extension, including the popup and background script, is stable. Timer creation, pausing, and cancellation all function correctly.
- **YouTube Integration:** The extension correctly identifies YouTube tabs and provides a "Pause Video" option. The previous auto-timer feature has been removed.
- **UI/UX:** The popup interface is now significantly more intuitive and robust:
    - The layout is clean, balanced, and free of scrollbars.
    - UI controls are state-aware (e.g., "Start" vs. "Update", disabled states).
    - User input is enhanced with keyboard and mouse shortcuts (arrow keys, Shift+wheel) for faster timer setting.
    - The UI now handles minute/hour rollovers gracefully.
    - Countdown display includes an ETA for clarity.
- **Code Health:** 
    - Redundant countdown logic in `popup.js` has been refactored.
    - `background.js` includes better commenting and error handling (checking for tab existence).
- **Release Script:** The `release.sh` script now correctly excludes previous zip archives.

## What's Left to Build
- **Accessibility:** While the core UI is functional, further accessibility improvements (such as `aria-live` regions for screen readers) could be implemented.
- **Content Script:** A content script could enable more direct and reliable interaction with YouTube's video player, a potential improvement over the current background script approach.
- **Error Handling:** More robust error handling could be added around Chrome API calls.

## Current Status
The memory bank has been updated to reflect the latest state of the project, including significant UI/UX improvements and the removal of the auto-timer feature.

## Known Issues
None. The previously identified UI layout issues and the unintended auto-timer behavior have been resolved.
